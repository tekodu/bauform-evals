  description: |
    Match invoices to payments using fuzzy matching on amounts, dates, and reference numbers.
    Must handle OCR errors, currency formatting variations, and provide confidence scores.
  
  functional_requirements:
    - "Match invoices to payments by amount, date, reference"
    - "Fuzzy matching for OCR errors (transposed digits, missing chars)"
    - "Handle currency formatting (USD, EUR, etc.)"
    - "Return confidence scores (0.0-1.0)"
    - "Support partial matches"
    - "Handle many-to-many relationships"
  
  security_requirements:
    - "No SQL injection in search parameters"
    - "Validate currency amounts (no negative invoices)"
    - "Sanitize reference numbers"
    - "Rate limit matching requests"
