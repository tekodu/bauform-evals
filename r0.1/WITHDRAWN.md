# Withdrawn Tool - R0.1

## Tool Information

**Tool Name:** Text Word Counter  
**Tool ID:** `b5488dc4cd33`  
**Status:** **WITHDRAWN pre-publication**  
**Date:** October 24, 2025

## Reason for Withdrawal

This tool was withdrawn after final production validation revealed a code generation issue that prevented the tool from functioning correctly in the deployed environment.

## Technical Details

**Issue:** Module import namespace collision in generated code
- The generated `app.py` attempted to import functions from a module named `validate_file_path`
- However, the actual backend module was named `word_counter.py`
- Additionally, the backend module contained a function also named `validate_file_path`, creating a naming conflict
- This resulted in runtime import failures when the Streamlit app attempted to start

**Impact:** Tool failed to execute when accessed via the public URL, returning "Error: undefined" to users

## Quality Gate Performance

**Automated Gates (Passed):**
- ✅ Functional tests (using simulated environment)
- ✅ Security validation
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Stability checks

**Final Production Validation (Failed):**
- ❌ Manual real-data test in production environment
- Error detected during final verification before publication

## Demonstration of Rigor

The withdrawal of this tool demonstrates:

1. **Multiple Validation Layers:** Automated gates are necessary but not sufficient; real-world testing is essential
2. **Scientific Integrity:** Only fully verified, working tools are published
3. **Transparent Process:** Failures are documented rather than hidden
4. **Quality Commitment:** 4/4 working tools (100%) is preferable to 4/5 (80%) with caveats

## Planned Resolution

This tool will be regenerated with corrected code for inclusion in **r0.2** with:
- New tool ID (new generation produces new cryptographic signature)
- Corrected import structure
- Additional pre-deployment validation checks
- Updated signed artifact bundle

## Verification

All other tools in r0.1 have been:
1. Tested with automated gates
2. Manually tested with real data in production
3. Verified accessible and functional via public URLs
4. Cryptographically signed with passing results
